                Welcome to my portfolio website!
                I'm Henry, a high school student from NYC with a strong ambition to become a skilled software engineer.
                <i>I aim to create engaging, accessible apps for the web.</i>
                When it comes to JavaScript frameworks, <i>Nuxt.js</i> is my go-to choice, and I have over three years of hands-on experience in web development.
                I'm constantly expanding my knowledge by embracing new technologies and eagerly seeking new opportunities to grow.
                One of my goals for the upcoming year is to get better at competitive programming and familiarizing myself with C++.
                In my free time, I enjoy watching anime, playing videogames, going on short runs, and listening to music.
                Some of my favorite genres are K-pop, J-pop, and R&B.
                Feel free to explore my website and discover more about my journey!
                Thanks for visiting and taking the time to explore my personal portfolio!
