                Welcome to my portfolio website!
                I'm Henry, a high school student from NYC with a strong ambition to become a skilled software engineer.
                <i>I aim to create engaging, accessible apps for the web.</i>
                One of the most important things to me is creating meaningful work that impacts the communities I'm involved in.
                When it comes to JavaScript frameworks, <i>Nuxt.js</i> is my go-to choice, and I have over three years of hands-on experience in web development.
                I'm constantly expanding my knowledge by embracing new technologies and eagerly seeking new opportunities to grow.
                My goals this upcoming year include getting better at <i>competitive programming</i> and familiarizing myself with <i>C++.</i>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me watching anime, playing videogames, going on short runs, or listening to music.
                Some of my favorite genres are K-pop, J-pop, and R&B.
                Feel free to explore my website and discover more about my journey!
                Thanks for visiting and taking the time to explore my personal portfolio!
