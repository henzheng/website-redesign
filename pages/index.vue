                Welcome to my portfolio website!
                I'm Henry, a high school student from NYC with a strong ambition to become a skilled software engineer.
                <i>I aim to create engaging, accessible apps for the web.</i>
                One of the most important things to me is creating meaningful work that impacts the communities I'm involved in.
                When it comes to JavaScript frameworks, <i>Nuxt.js</i> is my go-to choice, and I have over three years of hands-on experience in web development.
                I'm constantly expanding my knowledge by embracing new technologies and eagerly seeking new opportunities to grow.
                My goals this upcoming year include getting better at <i>competitive programming</i> and familiarizing myself with <i>C++.</i>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me watching anime, playing videogames, going on short runs, or listening to music.
                Some of my favorite genres are K-pop, J-pop, and R&B.
                Feel free to explore my website and discover more about my journey!
                Thanks for visiting and taking the time to explore my personal portfolio!

                If you couldn't already tell, I'm a big fan of Pokemon and it served as the inspiration behind this website.
                Pokemon Diamond and Pearl is my favorite game from the series, and it was the game the introduced me to the world of Pokemon.
                From the very beginning, the game's seemingly endless world, beautiful music, and intriguing characters capitivated my imagination and fueled my love for the franchise.
                From trading and collecting Pokemon cards during my childhood to delving into the competitive scene of Sword and Shield, where I proudly attained master ball rank in both singles and doubles battle formats, my journey as a part-time Pokemon trainer and developer has been exhilarating.
