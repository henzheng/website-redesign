            Hello, my name is Henry! I'm a high school student aspiring to be a software engineer.
            I was introduced to the world of programming through the TI-84 Calculator. 
            Surprisingly, messing around with TI-Basic teaches you a lot of core programming principles!
            After this experience sparked my curiousity, I went on to learn Python as my first programming language. 
            Many of my early projects were Discord bots made using Discord.py, an API wrapper for Discord. 
            However, recently I have been much more interested in web development and machine learning. 
            For instance, this website was built using Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS!
