                Over the course of my high school career, I have always been proactive in seeking out internship opportunities. 
                I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for various tech companies, where <i>I honed my programming abilities and learned to adapt to a professional environment.</i> 
                These internships have provided me with invaluable insights into the tech industry, and allowed me to work alongside experienced professionals.
                Through these experiences, I have grown both personally and professionally, paving the way for a promising future in the field of technology.
