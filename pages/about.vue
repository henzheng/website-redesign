                    Hey, Henry here!
                    I was introduced to the world of programming through the TI-84 Calculator. 
                    Surprisingly, messing around with TI-Basic teaches you a lot of <i>core programming principles!</i>
                    After this experience sparked my curiousity, I went on to learn <i>Python</i> as my first programming language. 
                    Many of my early projects were Discord bots made using Discord.py, an API wrapper for Discord. 
                    However, in recent years, I have been much more interested in <i>web development and machine learning</i>. 
                    In fact, this website was built using <i>Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS!</i>
                </p>

                    Growing up in the vibrant metropolis of New York City, I've always lived by the motto "Excelsior," meaning "ever upward." 
                    This motto resonates deeply with my approach to programming. 
                    I firmly believe in the power of constant improvement and never settling for mediocrity. 
                    With each project, I strive to push boundaries, embrace innovation, and deliver exceptional web experiences.
