                    I was introduced to the world of programming through the TI-84 Calculator. 
                    Surprisingly, messing around with TI-Basic teaches you a lot of <i>core programming principles!</i>
                    After this experience sparked my curiousity, I went on to learn <i>Python</i> as my first programming language. 
                    Many of my early projects were Discord bots made using Discord.py, an API wrapper for Discord. 
                    However, in recent years, I have been much more interested in <i>web development and machine learning</i>. 
                    In fact, this website was built using <i>Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS!</i>

                    Over the course of my high school career, I have always been proactive in seeking out internship opportunities. 
                    I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for various tech companies, where <i>I honed my programming abilities and learned to adapt to a professional environment.</i> 
                    These internships have provided me with invaluable insights into the tech industry, and allowed me to work alongside experienced professionals.
                    Through these experiences, I have grown both personally and professionally, paving the way for a promising future in the field of technology.
